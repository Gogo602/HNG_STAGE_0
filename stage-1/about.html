            <h2>My Background and Bio</h2>
            <p>
                I am a highly driven Frontend Developer with a robust background in building scalable, accessible, and
                high-performance web applications. My expertise spans the core web technologies—HTML5, CSS3, and
                JavaScript—and extends into modern frameworks, notably React and Next.js. I am passionate about
                engineering clean, modular code and leveraging modern UI libraries and tooling to deliver exceptional
                user experiences. My commitment to continuous self-improvement is central to my work, driving me to
                tackle complex technical challenges and consistently exceed project expectations.

            <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
            <p>
                While I possess a strong foundation in core frontend development, including professional experience
                with
                frameworks like React and Next.js, this program requires continuous introspection and growth. I
                currently
                designate advanced asynchronous JavaScript patterns as my main area for immediate focus.
                Specifically, I
                aim to master highly optimized API request handling, intricate promise orchestration, and ensuring
                flawless error recovery within complex asynchronous loops and callbacks. This is not a low
                confidence
                area in my basic skills, but rather a commitment to pushing my limits to the absolute pinnacle of
                high-performance Vanilla JS, which is essential for becoming a truly versatile senior developer.

            <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
            <p>
                Future Self: Never forget the energy and determination you brought to this HNG program. Remember the
                late nights
                coding and the satisfaction of building something from scratch. You already possess the expertise in
                React and
                Next.js—now, keep challenging yourself with the complex, non-framework tasks. Stay curious, stay
                sharp, and
                always choose the path of continuous learning over complacency. Keep building!

        <section data-testid="test-about-extra">
            <h2>Extra Thoughts and Reflections</h2>
            <p>
                The HNG program presents a unique blend of high pressure and rapid learning, perfectly simulating
                real-world
                agile development environments. My observation is that success hinges not just on technical
                aptitude, but on
                soft skills—specifically effective communication, time management, and the ability to search and
                debug
                independently. The transition from building controlled, static components (Stage 0) to complex,
                validated,
                multi-page applications (Stage 1) reinforces the value of semantic structure and attention to
                accessibility
                details, principles I intend to carry into all future professional projects.
